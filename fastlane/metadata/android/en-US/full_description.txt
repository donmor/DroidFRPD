This is an Android FRP daemon manager based on <a href="https://github.com/fatedier/frp">fatedier/frp</a> project.

frp is a fast reverse proxy that allows you to expose a local server located behind a NAT or firewall to the Internet. 
It currently supports TCP and UDP, as well as HTTP and HTTPS protocols, enabling requests to be forwarded to internal 
services via domain name.

frp also offers a P2P connect mode.

<h4>Ignore battery optimization</h4>
